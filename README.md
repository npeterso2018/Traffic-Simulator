# Traffic-Simulator
[WORK IN PROGRESS] Fairly rudimentary graphical simulation of traffic in Python.

A simulation of traffic, inspired by (the little) traffic on Interstate 95 in Maine, near Colby College.

I created this in PyCharm Community Edition. This project needs Zelle's Graphics package installed in the project interpreter:

In PyCharm CE, go to Preferences... > Project: Freeway Simulator > Project Interpreter. Press the plus sign in the bottom left corner and search "Graphics." You want the package created by John Zelle. Install the package, and then the program should run correctly. Poke around and change up the file, take a look, hopefully I explained each function well! There are many different variables at the beginning of the file that can be changed!

PLANNED UPDATES:

-Exits

-Toll booths and Toll lanes

-Ability to simulate without graphics, but on a much larger scale

-Different scenarios, demonstrating the functionality of the simulation

POTENTIAL UPDATES:

-Traffic cops

-Two-way traffic

-Better graphics (would take a really long time)
