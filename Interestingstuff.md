Interesting things that I've found from experimenting with the simulation:

-Increasing the number of lanes from 1 to 2 just about doubles passenger flow (makes sense, but it was good to test it).
-HOV Lanes don't seem to help the overall flow of traffic very much. It will, however, incentivize people to carpool.
-Toll booths make a lot of money quickly, but kind of destroy the flow of traffic.
