Interesting things that I've found from experimenting with the simulation:

-Increasing the number of lanes from 1 to 2 just about doubles passenger flow (makes sense, but it was good to test it).

-HOV Lanes don't seem to help the overall flow of traffic very much. It will, however, incentivize people to carpool.

-Toll booths make a lot of money quickly, but kind of destroy the flow of traffic.

-Toll booths also ruin the purpose of the bus and large-vehicle lanes by making it so that cars coming in from the entrance(s) cannot merge and get out of those lanes, by creating a gridlock of trucks and busses in the regular lanes.
